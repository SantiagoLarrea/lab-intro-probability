In the business world, making informed decisions is crucial, especially when faced with uncertainties. This lab focuses on scenarios where probabilistic outcomes play a significant role in shaping strategies and outcomes. Students will engage in exercises that require assessing and choosing optimal paths based on data-driven insights. The goal is to enhance your skills by applying probability concepts to solve real-world problems."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SNE7B0To5H-7"},"source":["**Challenge 1**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VoJuop125H-8"},"source":["#### Ironhack Airlines\n","\n","Often Airlines sell more tickets than they have seats available, this is called overbooking.
